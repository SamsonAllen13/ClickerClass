# Clicker Class
Adds the 'Clicker Class', a joke set of weapons. Don't hurt yourself!

## Mod Compatibility
If you wish to add clicker related content in your own mod, head over to our [ClickerClassExampleMod](https://github.com/SamsonAllen13/ClickerClassExampleMod) repo.

## Localization
If you wish to contribute translations, visit the [tML wiki page](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Localization) on that.
This mod uses `.hjson` files in the `Localization` folder.
Translate things that are in english and commented out (either via `//` or `/* */`, remove the comment markers after translating). For an overview of how much is already translated, check the `TranslationsNeeded` file.
